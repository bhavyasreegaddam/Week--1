            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="h0">Cooking Terms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Marination: The process of soaking meat, seafood, or vegetables in a mixture of spices, yogurt.</li>
            <li>Dum: A slow cooking technique where the biryani is cooked on a low flame, often with the lid sealed with dough, to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the essence of the spices.</li>
            <li>Bhoona: The method of sautéing spices and ingredients until they release their oils and become aromatic, forming the base of the biryani masala.</li>
            <li>Deglazing: Adding liquid to a hot pan to loosen and dissolve the browned bits of food stuck to the bottom, creating a rich and flavorful base for the biryani.</li>
            <li>Layering: The process of alternating layers of partially cooked rice and marinated meat or vegetables in a pot before the final cooking stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="my-2">Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Preparing the Rice</h3>
        <p>1. Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.<br>
            2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.<br>
            3. Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Marinating the Chicken</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated.<br> Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Cooking the Chicken</h3>
        <p>1. Heat the ghee or oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.<br>
            2. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnish.<br>
            3. Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies to the pot and sauté for another 2-3 minutes.<br>
            4. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and oil starts to separate.<br>
            5. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is almost cooked through. Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala powder. Stir well to combine.<br>
            6. Add chopped coriander and mint leaves. Mix well.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4: Layering the Biryani</h3>
        <p>1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) if you plan to use the oven for the final cooking step.<br>
            2. In the same pot with the cooked chicken, spread half of the par-cooked rice over the chicken layer.<br>
            3. Drizzle half of the saffron milk over the rice (if using). Repeat with the remaining rice and saffron milk.<br>
            4. Sprinkle the reserved fried onions on top. You can also add more fresh coriander and mint leaves.<br>
            5. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil to seal in the steam.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5: Cooking the Biryani (Dum Cooking)</h3>
        <p>If using the stovetop, place a tawa (griddle) under the pot to prevent direct heat. Cook on low heat for 25-30 minutes.<br>
            If using the oven, place the sealed pot in the preheated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes.<br>
            After the cooking time, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening the lid.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6: Serving the Biryani</h3>
        <p>Gently fluff up the rice with a fork, mixing the layers.<br>
            Serve hot, garnished with lemon slices and additional fresh coriander leaves, if desired.
        </p>
