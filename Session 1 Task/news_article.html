    <h1>AP ELECTION RESULTS 2024</h1>
    <img src="../Tdp.jpg">
    <p>The 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections marked a significant political shift in the state. The elections, held on May 13, 2024, were part of the simultaneous Lok Sabha polls. With a total of 175 seats in the Assembly, a majority of 88 seats was required to form the government.
        The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), led by N. Chandrababu Naidu, achieved a substantial victory, securing 134 of the 175 seats. This was a remarkable turnaround for the TDP, which had managed only 23 seats in the 2019 elections. The TDP's alliance included the Jana Sena Party (JSP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The JSP, led by Pawan Kalyan, won 21 seats, while the BJP, under the leadership of Daggubati Purandeswari, secured 11 seats.The Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), headed by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, faced a dramatic decline. The YSRCP, which had won a commanding 151 seats in 2019, managed to secure only 10 seats in 2024. This significant loss means the YSRCP will not have the status of the Opposition party in the Assembly, which requires at least 18 seats.Several factors contributed to the shift in voter sentiment. The TDP capitalized on anti-incumbency sentiments and presented a strong alliance strategy. Their campaign focused on economic development, infrastructure projects, and addressing local issues that resonated with the electorate.
        The YSRCP, despite its previous dominance, struggled to maintain its voter base. Issues such as allegations of corruption, unmet promises, and internal party conflicts likely contributed to their poor performance. The party's significant reduction in seats marks a crucial turning point, necessitating a reevaluation of their strategies and policies.The detailed constituency results show that the TDP gained substantial leads in many key regions. For instance, in Ichchapuram, the TDP candidate Ashok Bendalam won with a significant lead of 39,783 votes, securing 59% of the vote share. Similarly, in Palasa, TDPâ€™s Gouthu Sireesha won with a 40,350 vote lead, capturing 60% of the votes. These victories reflect the TDP's strong grassroots campaign and voter mobilization efforts.    </p>
