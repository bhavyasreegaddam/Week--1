        <p>Chandragiri Fort, located in the town of Chandragiri near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, is a historical marvel that dates back to the 11th century. Originally built by the Yadava Naidu kings, the fort gained prominence under the Vijayanagara Empire, particularly during the reign of King Krishna Deva Raya. Perched atop a hill, the fort offers panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and stands as a testament to the architectural and strategic prowess of its builders. The complex is divided into two main structures: the Raja Mahal (King's Palace) and the Rani Mahal (Queen's Palace). The Raja Mahal, now converted into an archaeological museum, showcases a rich collection of artifacts, including sculptures, paintings, and inscriptions that highlight the region's cultural and historical significance. The architecture of the fort, with its majestic gateways, sturdy walls, and intricate designs, reflects the grandeur of the Vijayanagara style. Chandragiri Fort is also linked with the last refuge of the Vijayanagara kings after the fall of the empire at the Battle of Talikota. Today, it stands as a popular tourist attraction, drawing history enthusiasts
